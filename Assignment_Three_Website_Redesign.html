<h1 id="home_header"> Welcome to my website! </h1>
<p> (TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL SITE)
      This website was basically created because I had to make it for a web design class a few years ago. I'm aware that it looks like something from the late 90s and doesn't have that much of a purpose. But it does have pretty detailed information on my Zelda Classic quests. What is Zelda Classic, you may ask? Well, you can find out on the "ZC Quests" page. As of now, I have three completed quests. I do want to make another at some point, but have no plans to start on it in the immediate future.
      </p>
      <p> I also have a complete list of my YouTube videos here, as well as a FAQ to hopefully stop some of the usual questions that I get. The Let's Play / Video list is basically a more detailed version of my various YouTube playlists. It should now be easier to find a specific game that I did, and also easier to see all the smaller stuff I've done that was previously tucked away in a playlist that some people might not even look at. I encourage everyone who enjoys my videos to check it out. </p>
      <p> I do have a LP of Pokémon SoulSilver on this site though. It's the only text LP I've ever done, and I think it's at least halfway decent, so check it out if you're interested. I have a couple other Pokémon pages too, but they're somewhat outdated. I don't hate trading quite as much as I used to (but I do still think people abuse it too much).
      </p>
     <p> To navigate, use the left frame. To return home, you can click the Bikdip in the upper left corner. If the frame isn't showing up, you probably reached the site through a link to a specific page. Since I suck at html, you'll just have to use this link to reset it. If the frame is showing up, you can use that link to cause massive chaos. It's pointless AND stupid. </p>
