    <h1> Devin Brzozowski-Greenwood - The (Aspiring) Artist</h1>

<p> Devin Tyler Brzozowski-Greenwood was born June 14th, 2001 to his mother; Joana Brzozowski-Haskett and his father; Brad Greenwood in the city of Welland, Ontario, Canada. </p>
<p>Two years later, his brother Avery James Brzozowski-Greenwood was born on August 21st, 2003. </p>
<p>During his early youth, Devin and his family moved multiple times between Welland and Niagara Falls, Ontario before eventually settling into his childhood home back in Welland. It was here that Devin attended St. Mary’s Catholic Elementary. </p>
<p>In the early days elementary, Devin was a gifted and polite kid, even passing on the option to skip the first grade. Pining for the opportunity to appease others, he was branded as an over-achieving teacher’s pet among his peers. This, however, did not last. </p>
<p>In the winter of his fourth grade, Brad Greenwood would leave his family for another woman. </p>
<p>Devin, while initially excited for the opportunity of extra responsibility, was soon crushed under the weight of reality. Between being seemingly outcasted by his educational peers, having to “man up” around the house for both his mother’s and brother’s sake, the continual strain his father was putting on their relationship, and all the trials and tribulations of growing up, Devin was sent spiraling into the depths of both depression and anxiety. </p>
<p>It was around this time his mother brought a new boyfriend home, Donald Hewitt, who would grow to build an abusive relationship with Devin alongside his family. </p>
<p>The constant pressure and anxiety drove Devin to section himself off from the world. However, the same pressure and anxiety inspired him to vent and cope through small scribbles in a notebook. Which grew to copying drawings, birthing a spark of creative drive within the boy. </p>
<p>After realizing his depression was only deepening, (and an unfortunate plethora of suicide attempts), Joana took charge and dragged Devin through a multitude of child therapists, all of which seemed cold and distant. That was until he met Shae Hutchedson, a kind, and warm councillor. Shae brought Devin much relief along with a prescription for anxiety/depression medication. Life was good as Devin graduated elementary school and migrated to high school life at Notre Dame College High School. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the high would end and drop extremely low. Devin would shatter under the pressure of high school, constant anxiety, crippling depression, and the worsening relationship with Donald. Devin would be again driven to suicide, this time however, he was administered to the McMaster Hospital in St. Catharines, Ontario. There he was held in the psych ward, coping through drawing on the scarce papers they allowed him. He was released prematurely and eventually broke down again, this time however, deciding to flee to his father and moved back to Niagara Falls. </p>
<p>The fresh start was everything Devin could have hoped for and more. Keeping with therapy and his medicine, he blossomed within his new enrollment at Saint Michael’s Catholic High School. While still very introverted, Devin was welcomed with open arms into a budding friend group and thrived. It was also here he met Sara Yablo, his art teacher. Yablo would prove to be an exceptional instructor and personal inspiration to Devin, encouraging him to pursue a life in the arts. Devin also began his first job, working for Digital Attractions Inc. To which he was promoted to Supervisor as he returned for his third summer, and to Assistant-Manager for his fourth. </p>
<p>In the final stretch of his twelfth grade, Devin’s relationship with both his father and his fiancé would sour. This lead to Brad packing Devin’s things and forcing him out. Devin scrambled to adapt, but no longer deterred by his future, graduated high school, and moved to St. Catharines alone to enroll in Brock University. </p>
<p>As of current publication, Devin is still enrolled at Brock University, studying Visual Arts and specializing in Studio. </p>
